# Side-Quests

Welcome to my collection of side projects, where curiosity meets code.
Most of these explore data-driven problems in finance, with the occasional dive into physics and modelling (because why not?).
Each “quest” is a small experiment built to learn, test ideas, and uncover stories hidden in data. Or, to be honest, just a bunch of half-finished projects. There’s really no in-between.
The goal is to explore what excites me most about coding and maybe discover a niche I can focus on. The projects might range from total chaos to unexpected brilliance, but they all reflect my curiosity and love for finding meaning within the lines of data.
