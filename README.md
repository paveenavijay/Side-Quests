# Side-Quests

Welcome to my collection of side projects, where curiosity meets code.
Most of these explore data-driven problems in finance, with the occasional dive into physics and modelling (because why not?).
Each “quest” is a small experiment built to learn, test ideas, and uncover stories hidden in data. Or, to be honest, just a bunch of half-finished projects. There’s really no in-between.
The goal is to explore what excites me most about coding and maybe discover a niche I can focus on. The projects might range from total chaos to unexpected brilliance, but they all reflect my curiosity and love for finding meaning within the lines of data.

Personally, while I do learn quite a lot through my structured classes and assignments at my university, I tend to thrive the best when I am not bound by a curriculum, where I can research and go as deep as I want to go. I always wondered what it would be like to jump into a deep cave with nothing but a fhashlight, forced to find my way out. I enjoy that feeling, where I need to critically think and crawl my way through the challenges that arise from teaching and learning on your own. That is what keeps me going, I find more thrill in tacking challengers and finding different way to solve them, understand its nature and prevent them. 

So there you have it, a short description on what you have signed up for. I hope you enjoy the ride, cause I know I did :)
