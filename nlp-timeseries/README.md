# Market Mood vs Market Move
(Giggling at the title right now)

## Goal
Analyze how public sentiment from Twitter, Reddit, or news headlines influences short-term stock price movements. This project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), Finance, and Time-Series Analysis, which I believe is a perfect mix of data-driven storytelling and quantitative insight.

## Conception of the Project 
I've been teaching myself NLP and I wanted to work on a project that also combines my new-found interest in finance. This was an excellent way to put my theoretical knowledge to test and translate what I have been learning into something practical and usable. 

## Overview 
The idea is simple:
Does the market’s mood affect stock prices?

Using a dataset of stock-related tweets labeled as positive or negative, we:

- Clean and preprocess the sentiment data
- Collect stock price data via APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance)
- Perform lag and correlation analysis to check if sentiment predicts returns
- Visualize relationships between mood and market movement
- Optionally, build an interactive Streamlit dashboard for exploration
